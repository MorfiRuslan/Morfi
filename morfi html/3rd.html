          <h5 class="card-title">1. Early Career and Rise at Bayern Munich (2000–2010)</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Thomas Müller joined Bayern Munich’s youth academy in 2000 at the age of 10. His intelligence, positioning, and finishing skills helped him stand out early on. He made his first-team debut in 2008, and under coach Louis van Gaal, Müller became a regular starter in the 2009–10 season. That season, he scored 13 goals in the Bundesliga and helped Bayern reach the UEFA Champions League final, marking a breakthrough in his career.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">2. International Stardom and World Cup Success (2010–2014)</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Müller gained international fame at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, winning the Golden Boot as the tournament’s top scorer with 5 goals and 3 assists. He became a key part of the German national team, known for his instinctive play and ability to exploit space.

          <h5 class="card-title">3. Club Achievements and Tactical Evolution (2014–2020)</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Between 2014 and 2020, Müller continued to be a crucial player for Bayern Munich. He won multiple Bundesliga titles and domestic cups during this time. Under different managers, he adapted his role, especially as a "Raumdeuter" (space interpreter), focusing on intelligent positioning rather than traditional attacking methods. He was also part of the squad that won the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, completing a second continental treble with Bayern.</p>

Despite his unconventional style, he remains highly effective, contributing with assists, key passes, and leadership on the field. He has become Bayern Munich’s all-time leader in assists and continues to be among the most respected players in German football. Though briefly left out of the national team in 2019, he was recalled for Euro 2020 and World Cup 2022, proving his lasting importance.</p>
